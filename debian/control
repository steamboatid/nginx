 Echo module wraps lots of Nginx internal APIs for streaming input and output,

 data accessing.
 .
 Basically it provides various utilities that help testing and debugging of
 other modules by trivially emulating different kinds of faked subrequest
 locations.
 .
 People will also find it useful in real-world applications that need to:
 .
 1. Serve static contents directly from memory.
 2. Wrap the upstream response with custom header and footer (kinda like the
    addition module but with contents read directly from the config file and
    Nginx variables).
 3. Merge contents of various "Nginx locations" (i.e., subrequests) together in
    a single main request (using echo_location and its friends).

 coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to
 the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is
 similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression.
 .
 This package contains the filter module.

Description: A NGINX module designed to validate actors claiming to be
 search engine indexers. It is right to disable security mechanisms for
 valid search engine bots to ensure your controls do not interfere with
 page rankings on any of the search providers. The issue is that the
 User Agent header cannot be trusted. In order to ensure you are allowing
 only valid search engine indexers, you must validate according to
 their published standards. This module performs that validation and caches
 the results to ensure you do not pay validation penalties on every request.
